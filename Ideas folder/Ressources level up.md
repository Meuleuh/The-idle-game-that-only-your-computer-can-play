## Upon leveling up one ressource production, what would be the price upon leveling it up ?

Leveling up ressources is the core of producing more and more money through the progression of the game.
The thing is that, there's many differents possibilities for what would be needed upon leveling it up.

#### 1- No money needed, tools only

The one I dislike the most, since money is not needed ! If money isn't needed, there will be no limit on how much the ressource production
increase, resulting on an OP amount of ressources produced only after iteration #100 or so... How it would work:

- Leveling up an ressource production only require you to sacrifice one of the tool you produce during that iteration **or** on every future iteration...
- Since no money is needed for leveling ressource production, money production will only increment over time, but the money amount will never get down...
- Since money never lower, money doesn't have any value so where's the use of including it ?

#### 2- Both money and tools are needed

This one is one of the most logical possiblity, since it is following our world production needs.

- Leveling up an ressource production requires an incrementing amount of money, depending on the item actual level, and the sacrifice of one tool produced during this iteration **or** onr for each future iteration...
- Using this method would make ressource production more logical, and would give both money and tools productions an quite good worth...

#### 3- Money only, tools are only to sell

This one is also a good one to concider, since money is still needed tho'...

- Leveling up only requires an incrementing amount of mey, depending on the item actual level...
- Tools would only be sellable, which would make money producing faster
