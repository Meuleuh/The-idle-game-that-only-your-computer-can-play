## What should be given to the ~~player~~ computer upon starting a new save ?

For sure, to start a save, things must be given allowing computer to start making profit.

Two completly different possibility:

1- Give the computer the first ressource at level 1 so that it can already produce money upon iteration #1

2- Give the computer the ressources to buy the first ressource at level 1 so it can produce money upon iteration #2
